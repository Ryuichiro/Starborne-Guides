<h1 id="start-of-a-new-round">Start of a new Round</h1>
<p>Always check for completed Tasks and claim the reward as long as you don’t go over your resource capacity. It can be beneficial to wait for a Command Center upgrade before you queue additional buildings because the build time reduction is only applied for new orders, same story with the reduced costs from Smelting Plant.</p>
<h3 id="buildings">Buildings</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create an alliance (for the task, leave it instantly if you want)</li>
<li>Craft and equip a <strong>Willy Gamish</strong></li>

<li>Equip <strong>Wither Crux</strong> <em>[reward for all refineries 1]</em></li>
<li>Upgrade buildings in intervals to 1, 3, 5, 7 ,10 (CC has 6 instead of 7, to mess with us…)</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="fleets">Fleets</h3>
<ul>
<li>Queue <strong>5 corvettes</strong>, <strong>5 Scouts</strong>, <strong>5 Patrols</strong> &amp; <strong>2 Industrials</strong></li>

<ul>
<li>4x corvettes to Raid L-01 NPCs <em>[damage is split and you won’t loose ships]</em></li>
<li>2x anything (25 ships combined) for missions <em>[split 24/1 if you want to level one fleet]</em></li>
<li>∞ scouts with 1 ship each to reveal missions</li>
<li>1x industrial for Solar Flares and Outposts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Send <strong>4 corvette fleets</strong> to your marauder with all your corvettes evenly split between them</li>
<li>Send separate <strong>single scout fleets</strong> to reveal all missions you can find</li>
<li>Send <strong>industrial fleet</strong> to your cleared Marauders &amp; the solar flares you see</li>
<li>Send <strong>2 fleets of any type</strong> with ships split 24/1 to do L-01 missions. (one of the fleets has to match the mission type)</li>
</ul>
