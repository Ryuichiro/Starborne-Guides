<p>Search for a location with as many free hexes as possible. Your main cluster will have a radius of 2 with as many stations in the 2. ring as T3 outposts in the 1. ring and center combined. Ice fields would be a plus but outside the main cluster.</p>
<h4 id="placement-priorities">Placement Priorities:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Navy Base</strong> at the center.</li>
<li><strong>Habitation Domes</strong> on hexes around the Navy Base.</li>
<li><strong>Stations</strong> on hexes around the Habitation Domes.</li>
<li><strong>Stargate</strong> so it affects at least 3 Stations, incl Station which has Navy Base.</li>
<li><strong>Scanner</strong> so it affects a Station which has <em>Civic Intelligence</em> &amp; <em>Communication Array</em>.</li>
<li>Additional <strong>Stations</strong> &amp; <strong>Habitation Domes</strong> for optimal Labor gain.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="notable-cards">Notable Cards:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Filtration Installation</strong> +1 radius for Habitation Dome</li>
<li><strong>High Command</strong> +1 radius for Navy Base</li>
<li><strong>Traffic Control <em>Tower</em></strong> +1 or <em>+2</em> radius for Stargate</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong><br>
Defensive fleets, which includes Scouts &amp; Recons against Sabotages, can all be deployed to the station which has the Navy Base.<br>
Offensive fleets can be deployed to one of the other two station under the influence of the Stargate. If the station is attacked deploy them to the other station so they won’t have to fight in the defensive battle.</p>

<p>Search for a location with the highest resource planet cluster you can find. As many hexes adjacent to the planets should be free and the hexes farther away should have high resource fields. Even empty fields are preferable over low resource fields.</p>
<h4 id="placement-priorities-1">Placement Priorities:</h4>
<ul>
<li>2-3 planets at the center.</li>
<li><strong>Mining Colonies</strong> on at least half the hexes around the planets.</li>
<li><strong>Mining Facilities</strong> so they affect as many resources from fields as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Stations</strong> on the remaining hexes. They have the lowest efficiency and their only advantage over Mining Facilities is that stations can also gather from planets.</li>
<li><strong>Missile Batteries</strong> on  the remaining hexes if their station has <em>Bellicose Industries</em> &amp; <em>Armed Drones</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="notable-cards-1">Notable Cards:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>APEX Mining Laser</strong> +1 harvest radius for Mining Colony</li>
<li><strong>Mining Cabal</strong> +1 slot for Mining Facilities</li>
<li><strong>Repair Drones</strong> +1 harvest radius &amp; -30% harvest yield  for  Mining Facilities</li>
<li><strong>Miner’s Guild</strong> +30% harvest yield for Mining Facilities</li>
<li><strong>Migrant Excavators</strong> +1 harvest radius for Station</li>
<li><strong>Pyroprocessing</strong> +17% yield  for Station</li>
<li><strong>Mining Robots</strong> +30% harvest yield  for Station</li>
<li><strong>Armed Drones</strong> +1 harvest radius &amp; +50% harvest yield for Missile Batteries</li>
