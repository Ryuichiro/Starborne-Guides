<h1 id="scanning">Scanning</h1>
<p>The scanning mechanic in Starborne is really simple at its core. You increase the <strong>scan strength</strong> on a hex to see more information about it, which includes: <strong>missions</strong>, <strong>hints</strong>, <strong>outposts</strong> as well as incoming and outgoing <strong>fleet movements</strong>.</p>
<p>If you already know how things work and only need a quick reference you can use this chart.<br>

<h2 id="part-1---exploration-view-mode">Part 1 - Exploration view mode</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QDQ26K3.jpg" alt=""><br>
The exploration view mode is your most important tool for finding mission. It will show missions you’ve already found in red, hints for other missions in yellow and colors the remaining hexes in different shades of blue, depending on your scan strength. You can spread your scan strength with stations and probes, but multiple sources won’t stack.</p>
<p><strong>Stations</strong> have:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>scan strength</strong> of <strong>10</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>+100</strong> based on their <em>Communication Array</em> building.</li>
<li><strong>+500</strong> based on the highest level <em>Scanner</em> outpost that influences them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>scan radius</strong> of <strong>0-10</strong> based on the <em>Surveillance Office</em> building
<ul>
<li><strong>+2</strong> /<strong>+5</strong> if you equip the <em>Surveillance Module</em> or <em>Detection Array</em> card.</li>
<li><strong>+1</strong> with a <strong>Machiavellian</strong> policy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Probes</strong> have:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>scan strength</strong> of <strong>1-600</strong> based on the fleets ships
<ul>
<li><strong>+5</strong> if you equip the card <em>Veteran Scouts</em>.</li>
<li><strong>+10</strong> with a <strong>Machiavellian</strong> policy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>scan radius</strong> of <strong>1-2</strong> based on the fleets ship type
<ul>
<li><strong>+1</strong> with a <strong>Machiavellian</strong> policy.</li>
<li><strong>+1</strong> /<strong>+2</strong> /<strong>+3</strong> /<strong>+4</strong> /<strong>+5</strong> if you equip a <em>Sensor</em> card.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>duration</strong> of <strong>24 hours</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>+24</strong> /<strong>+38</strong> /<strong>+72</strong> /<strong>+96</strong> if you equip a <em>Probe Duration</em> card.</li>
<li><strong>+24</strong> with a <strong>Machiavellian</strong> policy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disclaimer!</strong><br>
If you scan a hex with <strong>multiple fleets</strong> in one movement the probe only has the <strong>scan strength</strong> of the strongest fleet, not the sum of all.</p>
<h2 id="part-2---missions">Part 2 - Missions</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FozzRlO.jpg" alt=""><br>
Running missions is your only way to get a stable flow of cards for your Fleets and Stations.</p>
<p>To <strong>find a missions location</strong>, you have to remember a few rules about hints:</p>
<ol>
<li>The hint radius of a mission is equal to its level.</li>
<li>If hints of multiple missions overlap on the same hex it’s color is more saturated.</li>
<li>If you reveal a mission all hints for it will disappear</li>
<li>Stations can see Level 1 hints without a scanner and each scanner level increases that by 1,<br>
which means you need:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>10</strong> scan strength for <strong>Level 1</strong> hints</li>
<li><strong>110</strong> scan strength for <strong>Level 2</strong> hints</li>
<li><strong>210</strong> scan strength for <strong>Level 3</strong> hints</li>
<li><strong>310</strong> scan strength for <strong>Level 4</strong> hints</li>
<li><strong>410</strong> scan strength for <strong>Level 5</strong> hints</li>
</ul>
<p>To <strong>reveal a mission</strong>, when you think you know its location <strong>deploy a probe on the hex</strong> with the mission. Probes will always reveal missions on the same hex, regardless of their scan strength or the missions level. As an alternative you can try to increase the <strong>scan strength on the hex</strong> with the mission so high that it will be revealed, which means you need:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>510</strong> scan strength for <strong>Level 1</strong> missions</li>
<li><strong>600</strong> scan strength for <strong>Level 2</strong> missions</li>
<li><strong>605</strong> scan strength for <strong>Level 3</strong> missions</li>
<li><strong>610</strong> scan strength for <strong>Level 4</strong> missions</li>
<li><strong>615</strong> scan strength for <strong>Level 5</strong> missions</li>
</ul>
<p>To <strong>complete a mission</strong>, you have to send a main fleet and some escort fleets, which together have to meet the requirements of the mission. If your fleets have less then the <strong>recommended value</strong>, they will get a <strong>return speed penalty</strong> of <strong>up to 50%</strong>. Each mission is based on two parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>mission type</strong>, which determines the <strong>main fleets ship type</strong> and which <strong>stat</strong> is required.</li>
<li>The <strong>mission level</strong>, which determines the minimal <strong>number of escort fleets</strong> and the <strong>minimum</strong> and <strong>recommended values</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each time a <strong>mission is completed</strong> a new one <s>with the same level but a random type</s> will be generated <s>somewhere</s> on the map.</p>
<h2 id="part-3---revealing-outposts--movements">Part 3 - Revealing outposts &amp; movements</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kRmpnnD.png" alt="Placeholder"><br>
Like in most PvP games, knowledge is power! Knowing when fleets will return to an enemy station and where the outpost is you need to sabotage will often be a deciding factor for a strategic victory.</p>
<p>To reveal outposts and movements of other players, you have to increase your <strong>scan strength</strong> on their hexes above the <strong>signal interference</strong> of whatever you want to see.</p>
<p><strong>Outposts</strong> have a <strong>signal interference</strong> based on their tier, which means you need:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>110</strong> signal strength to see an <strong>Tier 1</strong> outpost</li>
<li><strong>250</strong> signal strength to see an <strong>Tier 2</strong> outpost</li>
<li><strong>370</strong> signal strength to see an <strong>Tier 3</strong> outpost</li>
<li><strong>490</strong> signal strength to see an <strong>Assembly</strong> outpost</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Movements</strong> have a <strong>signal interference</strong> based on the average of their fleets and the movement type. The interference of a fleet depends on the ship type and is <strong>0</strong> for <strong>offensive</strong>/<strong>defensive</strong>/<strong>industrial</strong> fleets and <strong>100</strong> for <strong>utility</strong> fleets, which can be increased up to <strong>500</strong> with <strong>cards</strong>. The interference of movement types is fixed, which means you need:</p>
<ul>
<li>fleets average + <strong>1</strong> signal strength to see <strong>raid</strong> &amp; <strong>assault</strong> movements</li>
<li><strong>100-500</strong> + <strong>25</strong> signal strength to see <strong>scan</strong> movements (only utility fleets)</li>
<li>fleets average + <strong>50</strong> signal strength to see <strong>mission</strong> movements</li>
<li>fleets average + <strong>70</strong> signal strength to see <strong>industrial</strong> movements</li>
<li><strong>100-500</strong> + <strong>100</strong> signal strength to see <strong>sabotage</strong> movements (only utility fleets)</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example, a good way to <strong>hide your assault</strong> is sending 1 offensive fleet and 1 utility fleet with maxed signal interference together. Then the opponent would need [(<strong>0</strong>+<strong>500</strong>)/2]+1 = <strong>251 scan strength</strong> to see you coming. So as long as he doesn’t have a <strong>strong probe</strong> or a <strong>Level 3 Scanner</strong> next to his station you’re invisible.</p>
<h2 id="part-4---sabotage">Part 4 - Sabotage</h2>
<p><img src="" alt="Placeholder"><br>
Sabotaging Outposts and Stations can be a big help and is near rly a requirement for effective Assaults in the late-game.</p>
<p>Sabotages are a special attack movement for utility fleets. It triggers a battle with the utility fleets of the targeted station or home-station of the targeted outpost. If the target is under the influence of a <strong>Navy Base</strong> all utility fleets from all stations under the influence of said Navy Base will defend against the Sabotage. The battle only has <strong>one combat phase</strong>, after which your remaining fleet does one attack against the outpost or station. If they do more damage then the targets <strong>sabotage defense</strong>, you win.</p>
<p><strong>Outposts</strong> will be <strong>completely disabled</strong> until it’s repaired by an Industrial fleet.</p>
<p><strong>Stations</strong> won’t be able to start industrial fleet movements for 5 minutes. This can be be improved with the <strong>Malevolence</strong> policies of <strong>Machiavellian</strong> players, which add the following penalties:</p>
<ul>
<li>All units of the station suffer a 15% health penalty</li>
<li>Stations are sabotaged 50% longer (overall 7.5 minutes)</li>
<li>All outgoing movements are disabled</li>
<li>50% chance to destroy the equipped character card</li>
<li>All buildings suffer a 25% health penalty</li>
</ul>
